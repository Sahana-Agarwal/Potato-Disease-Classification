# Potato-Disease-Classification

It is a web application that uses deep learning to classify potato leaf diseases based on machine learning. The user will upload images of potato leaves and the system will analyze and classify them into several disease categories such as "Healthy", "Late Blight" or "Early Blight". The system offers actionable recommendations to manage the diseases identified.

## Features
- Upload potato leaf images to classify diseases.
- Real-time predictions using a deep learning model.
- Provides disease-specific recommendations for managing the potato crop.
- Fast and efficient API powered by FastAPI and TensorFlow.
